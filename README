WARNING!

VERSION
    Version 0.003015

SYNOPSIS
    rvm.pl will provide a subset of the bash rvm.

INSTALL RUBY
    It is recommended to use Ruby::VersionManager with local::lib to avoid
    interference with possibly installed system ruby. Ruby::VersionManager
    comes with a script rvm.pl with following options.

  version
    Show the version of Ruby::VersionManager.

        rvm.pl version

  list
    List available ruby versions.

        rvm.pl list

  updatedb
    Update database of available ruby versions.

        rvm.pl updatedb

  install
    Install a ruby version. If no version is given the latest stable release
    will be installed. The program tries to guess the correct version from
    the provided string. It should at least match the major release. If you
    need to install a preview or rc version you will have to provide the
    full exact version.

    Latest ruby

        rvm.pl install

    Latest ruby-1.8

        rvm.pl install 1.8

    Install preview

        rvm.pl install ruby-1.9.3-preview1

    To use the Ruby::VersionManager source ruby_vmanager.rc.

        source ~/.ruby_vmanager/var/ruby_vmanager.rc

  uninstall
    Remove a ruby version and the source dir including the downloaded
    archive. You have to provide the full exact version of the ruby you want
    to remove as shown with list.

        rvm.pl uninstall ruby-1.9.3-preview1

    If you uninstall your currently active ruby version you have to
    install/activate another version manually.

  gem
    Pass arguments to the gem command.

        rvm.pl gem install unicorn # installs unicorn

    Additionally you can use reinstall to reinstall your complete gemset.
    With a file containing the output of 'gem list' you can reproduce
    gemsets.

        rvm.pl gem reinstall gem_list.txt # installs all gems in the list exactly as given

        rvm.pl gem reinstall # reinstalls all installed gems

LIMITATIONS AND TODO
    Currently Ruby::VersionManager is only running on Linux with bash
    installed. Better support of gemsets needs to be added.
